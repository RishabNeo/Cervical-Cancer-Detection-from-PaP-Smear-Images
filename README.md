# Cervical-Cancer-Detection-from-PaP-Smear-Images

I have utilized both Federated Learning (FL) and traditional Centralized Machine Learning methods, achieving around 94.5\% accuracy for centralized learning and 90.57\% for FL. To accomplish this, I employed Transfer Learning with DenseNet201 and ResNet101V2 as backbones. Notably, DenseNet201 demonstrated superior performance compared to ResNet101V2.
