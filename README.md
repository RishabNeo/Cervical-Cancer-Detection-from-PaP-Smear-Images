# Cervical-Cancer-Detection-from-PaP-Smear-Images

This Self-project aims to provide a solution for cervical cancer detection in women. A Pap smear, also called a Pap test, is a procedure to test for cervical cancer in women. A Pap smear involves collecting cells from your cervix â€” the lower, narrow end of your uterus that's at the top of your vagina. Detecting cervical cancer early with a Pap smear gives you a greater chance at a cure. 

I have utilized both Federated Learning (FL) and traditional Centralized Machine Learning methods on CNN, achieving around 94.5\% accuracy for centralized learning and 90.57\% for FL. To accomplish this, I employed Transfer Learning with DenseNet201 and ResNet101V2 as backbones. Notably, DenseNet201 demonstrated superior performance compared to ResNet101V2.
